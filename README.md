# video_agent

Welcome to the video agent tool. Part one of the tool is a simple script to download a video from Youtube and trascribe it. With the transcription in hand, you can eaesily use chatGPT or Deepseek to create some social content based on it. 
Part two will feature a script that turns a transcript into some delicious social posts. 

To use the script:
1. Make sure you have Python installed on your computer. Here's a guide to installing Python.
2. Install Cursor - a free AI-assisted IDE. It's basically a Virtual Studio Code with AI!
3. Download and open the videotool.py script.
4. In line 71 (the function call) change the arguments to match your own. First argument is the link you want to download, second argument is the folder you want to download into and the third argument is the nicknane you're giving the file. Make sure thet the nickname contains no whitespace since this messes with the script. 

Enjoy!
